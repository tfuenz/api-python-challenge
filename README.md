# api-python-challenge

Within the folder WeatherPy, lies the WeatherPy and VacationPy Jupyter files.

A separate document named api_keys was omitted via the .gitignore but contained the api keys named 'weather_api_key' and 'geoapify_key'

Finally, output_data is a folder that while initially empty, processes the results seen within after running the WeatherPy Jupyter file.
